Bike-Meter
==========
A simple speed and distance bike computer built using OpenCV and Python 3.

If you're using your bike on a home trainer and don't have the necessary speed sensors on it, this might help.
It uses OpenCV to count your back wheel's RPM and from there it computes the speed and distance
travelled for the current training session.

So you need to place your laptop/RPi/webcam beside the back wheel and to have a reflective sticker or
safety element on the wheel. Anything that spins with the wheel and is a bit different from it should work.
